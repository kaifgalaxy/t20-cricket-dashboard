## 📊 Cricket Data Analytics Project

### 🏏 Project Overview

This end-to-end project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing cricket player and match data using Python. Data was scraped from ESPN Cricinfo and processed using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to derive meaningful insights.

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Web Scraping**: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
* **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`
* **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* **Jupyter Notebook**

### 📌 Project Highlights

* Scraped real-time cricket data from [ESPN Cricinfo](https://www.espncricinfo.com/)
* Cleaned and structured unorganized HTML table data
* Performed player-wise and team-wise performance analysis
* Generated visual insights such as:

  * Top run scorers
  * Best bowling averages
  * Player comparisons
  * Match outcome trends
